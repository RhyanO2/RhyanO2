## Rhyan Oliveira
My name is Rhyan, Iâ€™m 18 years old, and Iâ€™m currently in my third year of high school. Iâ€™m studying Systems Development, where I learn about programming, development logic, and best practices for building efficient software.

Iâ€™m passionate about technology and innovation. Iâ€™m always looking to learn more and improve my programming skills. Right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into languages like JavaScript and Python, while also exploring the world of both front-end and ***back-end*** development.
