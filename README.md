## Rhyan Oliveira
My name is Rhyan, I’m 18 years old, and I’m currently in my third year of high school. I’m studying Systems Development, where I learn about programming, development logic, and best practices for building efficient software.

I’m passionate about technology and innovation. I’m always looking to learn more and improve my programming skills. Right now, I’m diving deeper into languages like JavaScript and Python, while also exploring the world of **back-end** development.
